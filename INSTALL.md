####Installation is quite simple.
You'll need pip, a compatible python. and the required libraries (in REQUIREMENTS.txt)

`apt-get -y install python-pip`
`pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`

NOTE:
	If yout launch `talos.py` prior to performing this, the script will attempt to install everything it needs automatically.
